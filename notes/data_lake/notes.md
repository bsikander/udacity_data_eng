## Hardware

#### Nubmers everyone should know

**CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
- The CPU is the "brain" of the computer.
- Every process on your computer is eventually handled by your CPU.
- This includes calculations and also instructions for the other components of the compute.

*Memory (RAM)*
- When your program runs, data gets temporarily stored in memory before getting sent to the CPU
- Memory is **ephemeral storage** - when your computer shuts down, the data in the memory is lost.

**Storage (SSD or Magnetic Disk)**
- Storage is used for keeping data over long periods of time.
- When a program runs, the CPU will direct the memory to temporarily load data from long-term storage.

**Network (LAN or the Internet)**
- Network is the gateway for anything that you need that isn't stored on your computer.
- The network could connect to other computers in the same room (a **Local Area Network**) or to a computer on the other side of the world, connected over the internet.
